## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**active** | **bool** | Indicates whether HTTP is enabled or disabled. HTTP is disabled by default for security reasons. HTTP should only be enabled in a trusted environment that does not expose any security risk. Otherwise, it is recommended that HTTP should be kept disabled and HTTPS should be used instead.  |
